mdutils
=======
This Python package contains a set of basic tools that can help to create a markdown file while running a Python code.
Thus, if you are executing a Python code and you save the result in a txt file, Why do not give it some format? So
Using files such as Markdown can give a great look to those results. In this way, mdutils will make things easy on
creating Markdown files.
